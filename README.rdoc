= ASCII Arty

Light-weight ASCII art generator

== Description

ASCII Arty is a little ASCII art generator that uses the Figlet library. Just feed it a string and it'll create a fancy ASCII art image.

== Features

- Figlet font library

== Examples
  # Basic usage
  $ ascii_arty 'Art!'
  # =>                 _   _ 
  # =>      /\        | | | |
  # =>     /  \   _ __| |_| |
  # =>    / /\ \ | '__| __| |
  # =>   / ____ \| |  | |_|_|
  # =>  /_/    \_\_|   \__(_)
  # =>                       

  # To use a different font
  $ ascii_arty 'Art!' --font slant
  # =>      ___         __  __
  # =>     /   |  _____/ /_/ /
  # =>    / /| | / ___/ __/ / 
  # =>   / ___ |/ /  / /_/_/  
  # =>  /_/  |_/_/   \__(_)   
  # =>                        

== Requirements

None (yet)

== Install

- (sudo) gem install ascii_arty

== TODO

- Need an actual executable file
- Ability to set custom configurations, so you don't have to constantly set the options (like font) unless you want to
- Some nice built-in utilities (to make for easier demoing)
- Font list should be stored as a hash, and not a string
- Font list should show samples of the faces in addition to the names
- Font list should be able to show a given range (fonts starting with specific letters, or a range of letters)
- Font list should be searchable (a la grep)
- Font list needs to be generated from a) included fonts and b) a user-specified location (see To Do about custom configurations)

= Note on Figlet

Figlet (http://www.figlet.org) implementation written by Tim Fletcher
(twoggle@gmail.com). Found originally in the text gem
(http://github.com/threedaymonk/text), and re-implemented here due to
its removal.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
